Implementing Logistic Regression for Classification

In this assignment, you will be implementing and training a logistic regression model for classification. You will be using Python to build the logistic regression model from scratch and then train it to classify different penguin species. This task will provide you with a deeper understanding of machine learning algorithms for classification and their efficient implementation in Python.


# Task

1. Do `exercise/excercise_0*.py` by following the instruction in the comment out. They are not grading items. So feel free to change as you wish.

1. Implement the functions in `assignments/assignment.py`. This is the grading item.

3. Git commit & Push Your edit.


### Instruction

1. You can import `assignments/utils.py` and use their functions (if any)

1. You can verify your implementation by using the exercise_0*.py scripts. If you prefer to work with Jupyter notebook, you can convert the Python script by jupytext. `jupytext --to notebook <name_of_script_file>.py`

2. [You can review your autograding results](https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/learn-with-github-classroom/view-autograding-results)

3. If you have any questions, use a special "Feedback" pull request to specify the part in question in the code. And text the instructors with the link. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/leave-feedback-with-pull-requests) for this Feedback pull request.
