# asc-data-preprocessing

In this assignments, we will learn the basic of data preprocessing for machine learning applications. Specifically, we will learn:

- Loading data with explicit Data typing
- Dealing with missing data
- Handing categorical data
    - class labels
    - ordinal data
    - nominal data: one-hot encoding
- Feature selection
    - Lasso
    - Sequential backward selection
- Feature importance
    - Regression coefficient
    - SHAP


# Task

1. Do `exercise/excercise_0*.py` by following the instruction in the comment out. They are not grading items. So feel free to change as you wish.

1. Implement the functions in `assignments/assignment.py`. This is the grading item.

3. Git commit & Push Your edit.


### Instruction

1. You can import `assignments/utils.py` and use their functions (if any)

1. You can verify your implementation by using the exercise_0*.py scripts. If you prefer to work with Jupyter notebook, you can convert the Python script by jupytext. `jupytext --to notebook <name_of_script_file>.py`

2. [You can review your autograding results](https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/learn-with-github-classroom/view-autograding-results)

3. If you have any questions, use a special "Feedback" pull request to specify the part in question in the code. And text the instructors with the link. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/leave-feedback-with-pull-requests) for this Feedback pull request.
